About a decade ago, a mysterious mechanized threat appeared here. They’re known as ARC.\n\nPeople have fled to the underground colony of Speranza, seeking supplies to survive, and shelter from the machines. Demand for resources is at an all-time high. But getting those resources is a risky job, and it isn’t for everyone.\n\n# But it is a job for you.\nThat’s why you’ve enlisted as a Raider, scavenging for vital supplies that are scattered across the landscape. Everything from leftovers from yesterday’s run-in with ARC to the unlikely remains of a pinball machine.\n\nOut there, the stakes are high, and you will have to fight for your loot. Lethal ARC machines roam the surface. And there are no rules in Calabretta, so beware of other Raiders.\n\nWith the traders in Speranza, trust is hard-earned and easily lost. You need to earn your keep. So don't come back from a quest empty-handed.","genres":"오픈 월드, RPG","categories":"멀티플레이어","tags":null,"developers":"Embark Studios","publishers":"Embark Studios","releaseStatus":"RELEASED","releaseDate":"2025-10-30T10:00:00.000Z","releaseDateRaw":"2025-10-30T10:00:00.000Z","storeUrl":"https://store.epicgames.com/p/arc-raiders","slug":"arc-raiders"},"latest":{"currency":"KRW","price":5890000,"basePrice":5890000,"discountPercent":0,"discountEnd":null,"recordedAt":"2026-01-28T15:58:37.174Z"},"history":[{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T17:01:42.536Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T17:20:19.325Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T17:26:28.020Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T17:36:31.848Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T18:08:11.122Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-18T23:42:53.286Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-19T07:49:13.319Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-19T15:50:03.385Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-19T23:44:53.122Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-20T07:48:15.195Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-20T15:55:08.919Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-20T23:46:18.007Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-21T07:48:55.135Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-21T15:57:16.811Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-21T23:49:24.483Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-22T07:47:41.482Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-22T15:54:47.287Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-22T23:45:20.516Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-23T07:45:27.816Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-23T15:50:00.289Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-23T23:44:34.468Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-24T07:39:20.229Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-24T15:41:33.617Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-24T23:42:55.343Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-25T07:41:26.707Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-25T15:42:13.060Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-25T23:44:08.454Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-26T07:47:14.284Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-26T15:52:39.371Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-26T23:47:13.780Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-27T07:48:08.081Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-27T15:51:03.193Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-27T23:46:36.687Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-28T07:46:47.255Z","price":5890000},{"recordedAt":"2026-01-28T15:58:37.174Z","price":5890000}]}
